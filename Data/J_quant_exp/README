This folder contains the constants of malnormality generated for the matrices of the form J = (1/2)(Re(U)+Im(V)), whose connections to quantum expanders we investigated
Due to limits on upload size, we had to split the data into three parts
mal_data_3_5.mat is a MATLAB cell with each entry containing a vector that contains all the calculated constants of malnormality at a specific dimension, the dimensions in this cell are from 3 to 5
mal_data_6_8.mat is a MATLAB cell with each entry containing a vector that contains all the calculated constants of malnormality at a specific dimension, the dimensions in this cell are from 6 to 8
mal_data_9_30.mat is a MATLAB cell with each entry containing a vector that contains all the calculated constants of malnormality at a specific dimension, the dimensions in this cell are from 9 to 30
summary_table.mat is a MATLAB matrix which contains the summary statistics of data vectors previously given. The columns of the matrix correspond to: dimension, mean of malnormality constants, median, variance, and size of sample
