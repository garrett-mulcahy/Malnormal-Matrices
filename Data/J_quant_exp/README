This folder contains the constants of malnormality generated for the real valued Ginibre ensemble.
gin_data_FINAL.mat is a MATLAB cell with each entry containing a vector that contains all the calculated constants of malnormality at a specific dimension
dim.mat is a MATLAB vector which gives the dimension for each corresponding component in gin_data_FINAL.mat
summary_stats.mat is a MATLAB matrix which contains the summary statistics of data vectors in gin_data_FINAL.mat. 
The columns of the matrix correspond to: dimension, mean of malnormality constants, median, variance, and size of sample
