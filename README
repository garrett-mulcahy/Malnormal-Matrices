We present the minimal code necessary to recreate the results given the Malnormal Matrices

Data consists of the constants of malnormalities calculated for the real-valued Ginibre ensemble and matrices of form J = (1/2)(Re(U)+Im(V)), the latter of which we detailed connections to quantum expanders
Hessians consists of the Hessians of the squared commutator norms as a function of the entries of a matrix. Once a matrix has been specified, its malnormality constant is just the square root of half the smallest eigenvalue. We employed this approach for matrices of dimension 3 to 18. 

We now explain the files. In order to run this code in MATLAB, all of these files need to be uploaded into MATLAB together in a single folder since they call on each other 

RandOrthMat.m is not original code, it is by Ofek Shilon, 2006. It returns Haar-random orthogonal matrices 

generate_mal_data_opt.m and generate_gin_data_opt.m use optimization to generate the constant of malnormality for a large number of matrices of form J = (1/2)(Re(U)+Im(V)) and matrices from the real-valued Ginibre ensemble, respectively. We used this approach to generate constants of malnormality for square matrices of dimension 18 and greater. For any additional data generation, we recommend using these files as opposed to the Hessian approach outlined below. 

generate_mal_data.m and generate_ginibre_data.m use an already calculated Hessian function to calculate the constant of malnormality for a large number of matrices of form J = (1/2)(Re(U)+Im(V)) and matrices from the real-valued Ginibre ensemble, respectively. We used this approach to generate constants of malnormality for square matrices of dimension between 3 and 17, inclusive. 

give_mal.m returns the constant of malnormality of a single matrix using by calculating the square root of half the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared commutator norm

give_mal_opt.m returns the constant of malnormality of a single matrix using optimization

hessian_creator_iso2.m created the Hessian files in the Hessians folder

make_a_ginib.m returns a real-valued Ginibre matrix of a specified dimension

maje_a_jig_real.m returns a matrix of the form (1/2)(Re(U)+Im(V)), where (U,V) are Haar-random orthogonal matrices

optimization_constraint_iso.m is the file containing the constraints of the optimization problem 

phi_iso2.m is the isometry between vectors and trace-zero symmetric matrices
